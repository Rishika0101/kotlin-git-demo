## In this repository, we have covered the Null-safety feature in Kotlin.

##### What is null-safety?

##### Null-safety defined as a procedure to eliminate the risk of null reference from the code. Kotlin compiler throws NullPointerException immediately if it found any null argument is passed whether it executes or not.

##### There are two ways mentioned here,through we can handle it:

### Safe call Operator or ?.
### Not null asserted call  or !!.
